# Micro Projects
This is a repository placing all hardware-non-intensive projects.
So far, due to the limitation of hardware usage, I can only implement the ones that supports compilation on a Macbook Pro and a MSI.
However, all of the projects link with my research and teaching tasks handled over the daily workload, while a few of them may scale up or scale down. Therefore, I use this as a repository to assist with my portfolio.
